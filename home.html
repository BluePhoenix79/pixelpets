                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your journey begins with choosing and naming your perfect pet companion. From there, you'll engage in daily care activities that shape your pet's happiness and development. Every decision matters—will you spend your currency on premium food or save up for that special toy?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you care for your pet, they'll develop and change over time! Consistent attention leads to evolution, new tricks, and special badges. Neglect, however, will show in their mood and health. The choice is yours—will you be the best pet parent possible?
